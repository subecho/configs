# What to do with the gtk.css file
`gtk.css` goes into `~/.config/gtk-3.0/`. This will make the titlebars and top
bar slightly smaller than the default.

# What do I do with the redhat.json file?
Place this file in the `/etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed`. This will allow
Chrome to be able to use the Kerberos certificates for authentication into
Red Hat services.
